However, swiftlets are wild animals protected by the law in several countries, including Indonesia, so their farming must be carried out with strict permits and regulations. Additionally, breeding and keeping swiftlets require special knowledge and skills, especially in ensuring the health and safety of the swiftlet nests. Therefore, it is advisable to consult experts and relevant agencies before deciding to keep swiftlet birds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How Long can Swiftlet Nests be Harvested?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The harvesting time of swiftlet nests depends on the type and life cycle of the bird. Some swiftlet species only produce one nest per year, while others can produce nests several times a year. Generally, swiftlet nests are harvested after the mating season or when the nesting season ends. Usually, the harvesting of swiftlet nests is done twice a year during certain periods known as &#8220;harvesting season&#8221;, depending on the region where the swiftlets are located. In Indonesia, the swiftlet nest harvesting season is usually carried out from February to March and from August to September. However, in practice, harvesting swiftlet nests must be done carefully and regularly to ensure the health and survival of swiftlets, as well as the sustainability of future swiftlet nest production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are Swiftlet Nests Halal for Consumption?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Among Muslims, there is a difference of opinion on whether swiftlet saliva is halal or not. The majority of scholars agree that swiftlet saliva is halal because there is no forbidden element in it. However, some argue that swiftlet saliva is haram because it comes from an animal that is neither a poultry bird nor a livestock animal allowed for consumption in Islam. Therefore, the issue of whether swiftlet saliva is halal or not is still debated among Muslims and requires a deeper study from both religious and health perspectives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Can Swiftlet Birds be Farmed?
